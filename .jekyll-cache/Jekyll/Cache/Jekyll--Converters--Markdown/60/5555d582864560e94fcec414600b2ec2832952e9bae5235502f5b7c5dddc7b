           <p>Liz is a sophomore Environmental Engineer still living in the glory of being president of FYEC. She is proudly from Duluth, Minnesota and resides in Farley Hall when on campus. When she's not stressing about her career or planning how to use First Years to overthrow the upperclassmen of ELC, she is probably running, curating tasteful Spotify playlists, enjoying a good shot of espresso, playing Ultimate Frisbee on the club team, or somewhere on North Quad in her hammock. She is also a Compass Leader for Campus Ministry as well as an A/V worker in OIT. Liz intends to eventually get her MBA and pursue Engineering Management. </p>
